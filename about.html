        <h1>About me and my work:</h1>
        <p>My name is Elspeth, and I'm a visual artist and graphic designer. My favorite medium is marker, specifically Copic markers. Drawing has always been my first love, and I try to sketch something everyday. As a designer, I'm interested in both print and web design, and how we interact with both on a daily basis.</p>

      <h3>How did I get here?</h3></header>
    <p>After studying Art History and Visual Art at the University of Chicago, traveling, and working in education for a few years, I realized I needed to be creative in my work. The spark: last year, a tarot card reader told me at my friend's bridal shower that I gave her strange, &quot;diagonal energy&quot; and that I was &quot;put on this earth to share my creativity.&quot; The timing of this was pretty uncanny as I was debating about registering for my first graphic design class. That night, I did it. And since then, I've been going for my dream of being an artist and designer.</p></section>
